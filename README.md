### Hi!

ðŸ”­ I am a neuroscientist at the University of Nottingham. Besides my [research](https://schluppeck.github.io/ds1/publications/), the following might be of interest:

- I had a short but very cool stint at the *Financial Times* as a British Science Assocation Media fellow - and [published some articles there](https://www.ft.com/search?q=denis+schluppeck)
- [Make West Bridgford 20mph](https://schluppeck.github.io/make-wb-20mph) - I am trying to get my town to adopt a 20mph default speed limit. Twenty is Plenty!
- I have several teaching related repos, including the material for some courses: [Learning Matlab](https://schluppeck.github.io/learningMatlab), [Data analysis for Matlab](https://schluppeck.github.io/dafni), [Experimental Design for Functional Imaging](https://schluppeck.github.io/edffi), an interactive explainer of [population receptive field mapping (pRF)](https://schluppeck.github.io/prf-explainer/), a collection of [Julia/Pluto.jl notebooks](https://schluppeck.github.io/hands-on-brain-data/) for teaching an "Intro to brain imaging" course
- [my staff/lab page](https://schluppeck.github.io/ds1) for the University of Nottingham
- publications on [google scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Av506w8AAAAJ&hl=en)
- sometimes, I tweet as [@schluppeck](https://twitter.com/schluppeck)

### Some of the tools I like include...
